# HCL-ECommerce-Capstone

This is the repository for the Capstone Project created during HCL Training.
  
Online Shopping is the process whereby consumers directly buy goods and services
without any intermediary service over the internet. The goal of this website is to
develop a web-based interface for an eCommerce website, the website should be easy to use
and hence the shopping experience pleasant for the users. The main goal of this website is:

> 1. To develop an easy to use web-based interface where customers can search for products,
view a complete description of the product and order the product.
> 2. Reach out to a larger audience - internet access is becoming so mainstream now that your
product/service can reach almost everyone on the planet with an internet-enabled device.
> 3. Your virtual shop remains open and operational 24x7 even if you/your employee are not
working- this might not be wholly true if your product is a service-which requires immediate
human-intervention.
